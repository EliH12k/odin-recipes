    <h1>Pizza Dough Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/image.webp" alt="" width="300px">
    <p>This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.</p>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
        </li1>
        <li>
            1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
        </li2>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon white sugar
        </li3>
        <li>
            2 Â½ cups bread flour
        </li4>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons olive oil
        </li5>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon salt
        </li6>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li1>
        <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li2>
        <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li3>
        <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li4>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li5>
        <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li6>
        <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li7>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li8>
    </ul>
